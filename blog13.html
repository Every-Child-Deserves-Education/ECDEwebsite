                <h2>Washington Foorball Team Controversy</h2>
                <img src="img/blog/blog-13(1).png" alt="" />
                <p>
                  The Washington Football Team, formerly known as the Washington
                  Redskins, are a historic franchise, with three super bowl
                  victories, and multiple Hall of Fame players. However, in the
                  past decade, multiple employees have had alleged racist,
                  sexist, and misogynistic behavior, along with accusations for
                  team medical mismanagements, and claims of toxic workplace
                  conditions. The team has also been plagued with a series of
                  losses. At the forefront of this is the team’s owner, Dan
                  Snyder, who has been labeled as the cause of these problems.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  A professional football team’s priority should be to protect
                  its players and secure them financially. However, they failed
                  to do so. Former Washington star offensive tackle and current
                  49ers tackle Trent Williams alleges that doctors mismanaged a
                  cancerous tumor on his head. In 2013, Williams, who was 25
                  years old, had a small bump on his head. Doctors for the WFT
                  ran tests and concluded that nothing seemed out of the
                  ordinary. Six years later, the growth on his head had grown.
                  Williams was diagnosed with Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans
                  (DFSP), a rare form of cancer. His doctors found the cancer
                  just weeks before it would have moved to his brain, proving
                  fatal. He had to undergo three surgeries, where part of his
                  skull was removed.
                </p>
                <br />
                <img src="img/blog/blog-13(2).jpeg" alt="" />
                <p>
                  “I almost lost my life,” Williams said in 2019, visibly
                  emotional. Williams risked leaving behind a young family. This
                  sparked him to hold out of Washington’s 2019 season, due to
                  his contract extension reasons, and Washington’s appalling
                  maladministration. Williams was eventually traded to San
                  Francisco before the 2020 season, and he received a 6 year,
                  138 million dollar contract extension.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Over the past decade, Snyder has created an unsuitable
                  workplace for his employees. In recent years, 15 of WFT’s
                  former cheerleaders have accused their bosses of sexual
                  misconduct. One of the cheerleaders alleged that former vice
                  president Larry Michael told employees to “collect ‘lewd
                  outtakes’ from a video of the cheerleader’s 2008 calendar
                  shoot” in an interview to Bleacher Report. Another former
                  employee, Susan Miller, accused Snyder of “treating women like
                  servants,” which lead to her resignation. Even some men
                  alleged sexism. Former quarterback Robert Griffin III, who
                  played in Washington from 2012-2015, revealed he was sexually
                  harrassed by staff members. Griffin will release his memoir,
                  Surviving Washington, in July 2022. The cheerleaders, Mr.
                  Griffin, and Miss Miller were part of the organization during
                  team president Bruce Allen’s tenure (2009-2019). Snyder
                  pledged to conduct a full organizational investigation, with
                  Congress and the NFL getting involved.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  This past year, emails were leaked between former coach Jon
                  Gruden and Bruce Allen. Gruden’s email contained racist and
                  homophobic remarks about NFLPA (National Football League’s
                  Player’s Association) president DeMaurice Smith, mocking his
                  lips as the “size of Michelin Tires,” and calling him a
                  “faggot”. These emails are a miniscule fraction of 650,000
                  emails collected from the Washington Football Team. Gruden,
                  who had coached the Raiders from 2018, was fired in October.
                  Gruden has since apologized for his actions, but reports
                  allege he plans to sue the NFL for being a “fall guy” for the
                  Washington scandal, as his emails were the only ones made
                  public.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  This problem goes way beyond Jon Gruden, however. The main
                  cause of the situation is Dan Snyder, who has enabled and
                  participated in inappropriate, toxic, and unprofessional
                  behavior. Snyder has been responsible for Washington’s poor
                  success on the gridiron, which stemmed from the issues he
                  caused within the organization. Snyder should be forced to
                  sell the franchise to a responsible owner who is committed to
                  ending sexual harrassment in the organizations and creating a
                  safe workplace. Mismanaging a player’s health and almost
                  causing his death is also a very serious red flag. Under his
                  ownership, Washington has been reduced to a pitiful state for
                  the past decade, both on and off the field.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  However, Washington has a small glimmer of hope in turning the
                  franchise around. Before the 2020 season, Washington hired
                  coach Ron Rivera, a reputable coach who took the Carolina
                  Panthers to the Super Bowl in 2015, and has been well-liked by
                  his players and assistant coaches alike. Rivera battled
                  squamous cell cancer during the 2020 season, while leading
                  Washington to a 7-9 record and a division title for the NFC
                  East. This displays progress, showing that Rivera is committed
                  to the success of an organization, even while battling a
                  serious health condition. We applaud Rivera for his
                  achievements, and hope his success will turn the franchise
                  around.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The Washington Football Team scandal, however, teaches fans
                  like us very valuable lessons. The cheerleaders’, Griffin’s,
                  and Miller’s stories teaches us to never be afraid to speak
                  out whenever you are in a toxic workplace, and you should
                  never feel ashamed to speak out if you are sexually harrassed
                  or assaulted. People are going to listen to you and take these
                  allegations seriously. Gruden’s firing teaches us to not make
                  hurtful remarks in a fit of anger, no matter the situation.
                  One bad comment can ruin one’s life for good. Hopefully, this
                  situation will be solved soon, with everyone getting the
                  justice they deserve.
